# Logbook

I have one week to complete the project, at the moment I am writing those lines, we are the 11th of December and have until the 18th to send it.

## Friday night

The first thing I need to do is to create my GitHub repository. After that (and updated my Rubymine license), I began looking around the web to find more informations about Ruby APIs.
I found a first interesting article : [https://www.synbioz.com/blog/tech/api-ruby-rails-gem-grape]().
I also found on GitHub may interesting and already done APIs to calculate the Fibonacci sequence, however I preferred not to look at them in the first time, but it was kind of cool to know that it exists if needed in the future and to compare, once my API will be done, if my performances are OK or not.

I wanted, from the beginning, to implement tests, and maybe a CI pipeline in GitHub, so I also looked information about this.

I chose from the beginning to do it in Ruby, mainly because I did a few projects using Ruby, I think it is a great language and mostly because it is used by Perfect Memory.
